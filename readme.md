A Trend Analysis on CORPORATION FAVORITA - An Ecuadorian-based Grocery Retailer
### Introduction
In the rapidly evolving business environment of grocery retail, data-driven insights are paramount to success. This project focuses on the development of a predictive Machine Learning model that unravels the sales trends within Favorita's wide store network, providing valuable insights into unit sales of various items, seasonal variations, impact of events, and store-specific behaviors.
Our aim is to provide Favorita with a more accurate sales prediction model to enable them optimize inventory management, anticipate demand fluctuations, and strategically plan promotions.
### Objective
Our main goal is to give Corporation Favorita a very precise sales prediction model. This model will be a valuable tool, helping Favorita manage their inventory better, react to changes in demand more effectively, and plan promotions more strategically. Basically, we want to make Favorita more competitive by giving them useful information to make smart decisions in the constantly changing grocery retail business.
Project Structure
The structure of the task revolves around examining and making sense of the data we received and developing a model based on it. It is about digging into the data, finding important patterns, and drawing meaningful conclusions from the analysis.
### Content
Initially, our focus was on visualizing the dataset to identify and address missing values within our time series data. To do this, we converted the 'date' column into a datetime format. Afterward, we generated a time-series line chart using the 'date' column, which helped us isolate and extract the date column from the rows containing missing values in the oil price data. Finally, we merged this cleaned oil price data with the prepared_train and test datasets.
#### Stationarity Test
The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test is a widely used method for examining whether a unit root exists within a time series dataset. The presence of a unit root suggests that the data is non-stationary, meaning it doesn't exhibit consistent statistical properties over time. In essence, when we perform the ADF test, we are determining whether the time series data is in a stationary or non-stationary state.
We also conducted a component analysis to break down the data into its constituent parts, including the Trend and Seasonality components. This analysis allowed us to gain insights into the fundamental patterns and structures within the data, particularly focusing on primary columns of the data such as store numbers, sales, promotion status, and oil prices.
#### Autocorrelation Analysis
Autocorrelation analysis, often referred to as autocorrelation function (ACF) analysis, is a statistical technique used to explore and understand the relationship between a time series data point and its past values at different time lags. It helps in identifying patterns and dependencies within a time series dataset. Once a time series has been made stationary through differencing, the following step in building an ARIMA model is to ascertain whether Autoregressive (AR) or Moving Average (MA) terms are necessary to address any lingering autocorrelation in the differenced series. However, there exists a more structured approach for this task. By examining the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plots of the differenced series, you can tentatively determine the counts of AR and/or MA terms that are required to model the data effectively. These plots provide valuable insights into the time series' autocorrelation patterns, aiding in the selection of appropriate model components.
### Conclusion/Recommendation
The statistical analysis performed reveals a significant difference in sales before and after the earthquake. The p-value, which is exceptionally close to zero, offers compelling evidence to support this conclusion: the earthquake had a noteworthy impact on supermarket sales.
Taking these findings and the statistical analysis into consideration, we can assert that the earthquake indeed had a significant, albeit not long-lasting, effect on supermarket sales. The sales data indicate a clear disruption and a shift in the trend, with elevated sales levels persisting for a few months following the earthquake.
Therefore, in summary, we can deduce that the ARIMA model, which achieved an RMSLE of 0.2, demonstrates a commendable level of accuracy when forecasting the time series data. An RMSLE of 0.2 suggests that, on average, the model's predictions deviate by approximately 20%. This level of accuracy can be deemed acceptable depending on the specific context and application.
Additionally, it is worth noting that we observed the necessity of differencing or transforming the time series data to attain stationarity before fitting the ARIMA model. This observation highlights the presence of underlying trends or seasonality that needed to be addressed for effective modeling.
